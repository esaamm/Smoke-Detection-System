# Smoke-Detection-System
The smoke detector project is designed using an Arduino Uno board along with an MQ-2 
smoke sensor, a Bluetooth module, a 16x2 LCD display, LEDs, and a buzzer. The project 
aims to detect smoke in the environment and notify the user via the LCD display, LEDs, and 
buzzer. In addition, the Bluetooth module allows for remote monitoring and alerts through a 
mobile device. The system is designed to provide an affordable, user-friendly, and effective 
solution for detecting and alerting smoke presence in a closed environment. The project is a 
great example of how microcontrollers and sensors can be used to create simple but effective 
systems for practical applications.
The LCD display shows the smoke levels in real-time and the LEDs provide instant visual 
feedback for smoke levels exceeding the threshold. The buzzer emits an alarm sound when 
the smoke levels reach a dangerous level. Overall, this project offers a simple and effective 
solution for detecting smoke and hazardous gases in real time with remote monitoring 
capability.
